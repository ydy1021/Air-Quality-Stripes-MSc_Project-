### Discussion Summary  

#### 1. Dashboard and City Comparison  
- Developed an interactive world map where clicking on two cities allows comparison of their PM2.5 levels.

#### 2. Interactive Features  
- The map is built with React, positioning cities based on latitude and longitude.  
- The goal is to provide users with an exploratory experience rather than just displaying all data upfront.

#### 3. Suggestions and Future Improvements  
- Consider overlaying **satellite data (e.g., 2022 PM2.5 concentrations)** with color scales consistent with the air quality stripes.  
- Explore different map projections (e.g., spinning globe vs. flat map).  
- Limit comparisons to a maximum of three cities to avoid clutter.  
- Combine historical data with current data to provide a comprehensive view of pollution changes.

### Conclusion  
- The dashboard is taking shape with strong potential for user engagement.  
- Next steps:  
  - Implement hover labels for city names and map zooming capabilities.  
  - Attempt to load and overlay satellite concentration data with consistent coloring.  
  - After refining the dashboard, return to improving the bubble chart visualization.  
- All progress and updates should be committed and tracked in the Git repository.
