### Discussion Summary  

#### 1. Personalized PM2.5 Visualization  
- Developed a mini tool where users can input their birthplace and birth year to generate PM2.5 visualizations for that location starting from their birth year.  
- Built on the existing air quality stripes work with added interactivity and personalization.  
- A static version was recommended for better shareability and accessibility.

#### 2. Suggestions for Visualization Improvements  
- Add summary statistics such as average PM2.5, percentage change over lifetime, and estimated life impact.  
- Consider adding features like a “famous people mode” or comparisons across multiple cities.  
- Animate the visualization by filling bars year by year to enhance storytelling.

#### 3. Next Steps  
- Fix bubble overlap issue—either manually or via automated layout logic.  
- Start prototyping the dashboard: define layout, functionality, and included content.  
- Ensure the project contains sufficient data analysis to meet MSc-level expectations.
