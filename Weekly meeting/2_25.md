# MSc Project Meeting Notes  

## Meeting Details  
- **Date:** March 2, 2025  
- **Time:** 16:00 PM - 17:00 PM  
- **Participants:** Student A, Student B, Dr. Darren White (supervisor), Dr. Kirsty Pringle (supervisor)  

## Agenda  
1. **Animated Visualization Presentation**  
   - Demonstration of the animated air quality stripes visualization.  
   - Discussion on optimization and future improvements.  
2. **Running Code on EIDF**  
   - Importance of running animations on a shared environment for reproducibility.  
3. **Tasks for the Upcoming Week**  

## Discussion Summary  

### 1. Animated Visualization Presentation  
- **Demonstration of the animation process**:  
  - The animation starts with a static background, and the trend line is drawn incrementally.  
  - Implemented using an `update()` function that determines which year to draw.  
  - The function is repeatedly called to extend the trend line over time.  

- **Exporting animation**:  
  - The animation can be saved as an **MP4** file for high-quality playback.  
  - It can also be saved as a **GIF** for looping, making it more suitable for social media sharing.  

- **Supervisor Feedback & Suggestions**:  
  - The animation should allow **modifying the interval** to control playback speed.  
  - A suggestion was made to allow users to **switch between different cities** dynamically.  
  - Consider adding **annotations** to highlight key historical events in air pollution trends.  

### 2. Running Code on EIDF  
- The supervisor emphasized the importance of running code on **EIDF** rather than local machines to ensure reproducibility.  
- **Key reasons to migrate the animation to EIDF**:  
  - Shared access allows debugging and collaboration.  
  - Avoids environment inconsistencies across different machines.  
  - Prevents memory limitations when working with large datasets.  
- The supervisor requested the animation script and output files to be uploaded to **GitLab** for version control.  

### 3. Tasks for the Upcoming Week  
✅ **Improve the animation functionality**  
- Implement **city selection** to allow users to choose different locations for visualization.  
- Adjust the **color scale and resolution** to match other visualizations.  
- Add an option to **adjust animation speed** dynamically.  

✅ **Migrate the animation workflow to EIDF**  
- Run the animation script on **EIDF** instead of a local machine.  
- Upload the code and dependencies to **GitLab** to ensure a consistent environment.  
- Test performance differences between local and EIDF execution.  

✅ **Prepare project report draft**  
- Include a section on the **importance of animation in data visualization**.  
- Ensure that **all code is documented** for reproducibility.  
- Submit an initial draft by **March 5** for supervisor feedback.  

## Next Meeting  
- **Date:** March 5, 2025  
- **Focus:**  
  - Progress on animation improvements.  
  - Running the script on EIDF.  
  - Feedback on the project report draft.
