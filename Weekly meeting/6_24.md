### Discussion Summary  

#### 1. Progress Update  
- Built upon last week’s world map dashboard.  
- Added multi-city comparison mode allowing users to click and compare up to three cities.  
- Clicking on a city displays its corresponding Air Quality Stripes for direct comparison.  

#### 2. Feedback and Suggestions  
- Supervisor suggested adding a satellite concentration map as a base layer, with colors consistent with the Air Quality Stripes to avoid confusion.  
- This would allow users to see both global pollution distribution and historical trends simultaneously.  
- Continue optimizing the previous city visualization including the bubble version.

### Next Steps  
- Investigate integration of satellite concentration data into the dashboard.  
- Improve and finalize the city visualization with bubbles.

### Meeting Conclusion  
- The project is progressing well with a clear feature extension.  
- Supervisor’s suggestions will help enhance the visualization’s usability and information depth.  
- Regular updates and iterative improvements are encouraged.
