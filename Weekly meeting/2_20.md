# MSc Project Meeting Notes  

## Meeting Details  
- **Date:** March 2, 2025  
- **Time:** 16:00 PM - 17:00 PM  
- **Participants:** Student A, Student B, Dr. Darren White (supervisor), Dr. Kirsty Pringle (supervisor)  

## Agenda  
1. **Code Storage & Execution Environment**  
   - Discussion on where the code and data should be stored and executed (GitLab vs. local machines vs. VM).  
2. **Future Air Quality Projections**  
   - Understanding SSP scenarios and how they influence PM2.5 concentrations.  
   - Tasks related to visualizing future air quality trends.  
3. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   - Implementing animated versions of air quality stripes.  
4. **Project Report Preparation**  
   - Reviewing project report requirements and upcoming deadlines.  

## Discussion Summary  

### 1. Code Storage & Execution Environment  
- The supervisors emphasized the importance of running code on the **VM** rather than local machines to ensure consistency and allow shared access.  
- **All code should be uploaded to GitLab** for version control and reproducibility.  
- As datasets continue to grow, running everything locally may become inefficient, so storing and processing on the **VM** is preferable.  

### 2. Future Air Quality Projections  
- Discussed how the **Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)** scenarios affect future air quality modeling.  
- **Three emission scenarios** (low, medium, and high) need to be considered, each with global model data extending to ~2100.  
- The supervisors highlighted the importance of avoiding **abrupt jumps when merging historical and future data**, requiring a weighting approach similar to past methods.  
- **Tasks assigned:**  
  - **Implement a slider-based visualization** for PM2.5 concentrations under different SSP scenarios.  
  - **Select 10 global cities** and generate time-series plots comparing different emission scenarios.  
  - **Summarize the dataset properties**, including resolution and time coverage, to facilitate data merging.  

### 3. Interactive Visualizations  
- The supervisors suggested creating an **animated version of the air quality stripes** to improve public engagement.  
- **Two animation approaches were proposed:**  
  1. Keeping the background static and animating the trend line.  
  2. Gradually revealing both the stripes and the trend line over time.  
- In the future, **interactive elements** could be added, allowing users to explore different locations dynamically.  

### 4. Project Report Preparation  
- The project preparation report is due in **three weeks**.  
- Students should refer to the provided **seven-page report template** and start drafting their reports.  
- The report should include:  
  - **Project objectives and background**  
  - **Work completed so far**  
  - **Future plans and milestones**  
  - **Potential risks and mitigation strategies**  
- **Action item:** Locate the report template, start filling in relevant sections, and seek feedback from the supervisors in the next meeting.  

## Tasks for the Upcoming Week  
- **Run all code on the VM and upload updates to GitLab.**  
- **Implement SSP-based PM2.5 visualizations**, including global maps and city-based time series.  
- **Develop an animated version of air quality stripes** using one of the proposed approaches.  
- **Start drafting the project report** using the provided template and outline key sections.  

## Next Meeting  
- **Date:** TBD  
- **Focus:** Progress on SSP visualizations, animation implementation, and project report preparation.
