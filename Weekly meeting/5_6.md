### Discussion Summary  

#### 1. **Presentation Content Feedback**  
- Presentation should better match weekly progress to specific **project goals**.  
- Clearly distinguish **goals** (e.g., improve accessibility) from **concrete outputs** (e.g., animations, dashboard).  
- Specify future work more clearly—what will be created by the end of the project (e.g., a dashboard, a video).

#### 2. **Clarifying Project Outputs**  
- When referring to technologies like **D3.js** and **WebGL**, clarify their purpose (e.g., used to build an interactive dashboard).  
- Audience may be unfamiliar with **air quality stripes**, so explanations should be accessible.  
- Make it clear whether outputs will be a **dashboard**, **Google Drive visuals**, or **YouTube videos**, etc.

#### 3. **Discussion on GUI and Automation**  
- GUI tool is valuable—reduces manual work for adding bubble annotations.  
- Can skip GUI video in the talk to save time; a verbal explanation is sufficient.  
- Emphasize that GUI helps manage data across **173 cities**, and reduces time from hours to seconds.

#### 4. **Suggestions for Final Slides**  
- Avoid overcrowded bubble plots—show just one (e.g., London), and **enlarge** for readability.  
- Acknowledge current issues like **label overlap**, and mention ongoing algorithm improvements.  
- Future work slide should **list expected outputs**, not just general goals.  
- Keep **conclusion slide** clear:
  1. Restate project scope in one sentence  
  2. Summarize current progress  
  3. Outline next steps

### Meeting Conclusion  
- Focus on improving the clarity of **presentation goals and deliverables**.  
- Be explicit about **what will be created** and how it improves over the original project.  
- Final deliverables should be easy to explain to both technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Practice timing and structure for a smooth delivery.
