### Discussion Summary  

#### 1. **Visualization Improvement and Optimization**  
- **Student A** reported progress on enhancing **animation and visualization** by adding a **dynamic bubble annotation system**.  
- The current challenge is handling **long text in bubble annotations**. The proposed solution is to use **word wrapping** or **multi-line text** to fit longer annotations.  
- The system currently calculates the **bubble offset** based on the data point position. If the data point is too low, the bubble is positioned above the line.  
- **Feedback from Dr. Pringle:**  
  - Consider making the bubble **narrower but taller** to accommodate long text.  
  - Use a **logic-based offset calculation** to place the bubble on the opposite half of the page when the line is too high or low.  
  - Test the system with **dummy data from multiple cities** to check the robustness of the bubble placement.  

#### 2. **Dynamic Bubble Annotation System**  
- **Current Approach:**  
  - Uses **two CSV files** to store annotation text and calculated offsets.  
  - The algorithm currently calculates the offset based on the **vertical position** of the data point.  
- **Proposed Improvement:**  
  - Adjust the offset logic to account for **horizontal placement** as well.  
  - Implement checks to avoid **overlapping or off-page bubbles**.

### Meeting Conclusion  
- Focus on enhancing **animation performance** and improving the **dynamic bubble annotation system**.
