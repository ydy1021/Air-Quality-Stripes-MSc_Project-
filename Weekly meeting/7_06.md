### Discussion Summary  

#### 1. Technical Overview  
- The dashboard is built using **React.js** and **Canvas** for rendering.  
- City coordinates were retrieved externally to display PM2.5 data from 2022.

#### 2. Documentation  
- Emphasis on writing clear **README** files for each module.  
- GitHub repository should include setup instructions for dashboard, animation, and bubble plots.

#### 3. 2D vs 3D Map  
- 3D version is still under development with some bugs.  
- Agreed to focus on the 2D version due to stability and performance.

#### 4. Download & Sharing  
- Add **PNG download** buttons for the three bottom charts.  
- Include image labels (e.g., title, website link, year) and a **color bar** for better readability.  
- Consider adding features to support social media sharing in the future.

#### 5. Next Steps  
- Finalize and document the dashboard, animation, and bubble plot code.  
- Add a third mode ("slider mode") to show historical changes over time.  
- Send GitHub repo and documentation to supervisors for review.

### Conclusion  
- The project is progressing well; focus now is on finalizing features and improving documentation.  
- Well-written technical notes are important for both the report and integration into the university website.  
- All updates should be committed to the Git repository.
