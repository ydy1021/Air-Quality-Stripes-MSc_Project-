# MSc Project Meeting Notes  

## Meeting Details  
- **Date:** March 10, 2025  
- **Time:** 16:00 - 16:50  
- **Participants:** Duyu Yang (student), Haocheng Li (student), Dr. Darren White (supervisor), Dr. Kirsty Pringle (supervisor)  

## Agenda  
1. **Report Progress Presentation**  
2. **Supervisor's Feedback on the Report**  
3. **Clarification on Project Scope**  

## Discussion Summary  

### 1. **Report Improvements**  
- **Enhance visualization content**:  
  - The report currently includes only two figures; more visualizations should be added to showcase progress.  
  - Clearly describe the **London animation (Figure 2)**â€”it is an animation rather than an interactive visualization.  
  - Provide **external links** where readers can view the animations in action.  

- **Explain visualization methods**:  
  - Justify why **specific visualization techniques** were chosen.  
  - Clarify the **intended message** of each visualization (e.g., Air Quality Stripes highlight trends rather than absolute values).  

- **Strengthen figure captions**:  
  - Captions should **clearly describe** what is being presented.  
  - Ensure the reader understands the visualization even without reading the main text.  

### 2. **Clarification on Project Scope**  
- **Balance between animations and dashboard**:  
  - The project should not rely solely on animations, as it might not be substantial enough.  
  - Explore **different types of animations** or combine animations with a dashboard.  
  - Ensure both components contribute meaningfully to the project.  

- **Define different user audiences**:  
  - Animations are for the **general public** to create awareness and engagement.  
  - The dashboard is for **researchers and professionals** who need in-depth data analysis.  
  - Clearly articulate these differences in the report.  

### 3. **Project Planning and Risk Assessment**  
- **Ensure a well-structured work plan**:  
  - Clearly outline all project phases from preparation to final report submission.  
  - Include **key milestones** with estimated timelines.  

- **Assess project feasibility**:  
  - If both animations and dashboard are included, ensure the workload is manageable.  
  - Plan the implementation in **modular steps** to ensure at least a minimal viable product is completed.  

- **Technical considerations**:  
  - Specify the **tools and programming languages** used.  
  - Address potential **performance optimization** challenges for smooth animations and dashboard interactions.  

## Tasks for the Upcoming Week  
- **Revise the report** based on feedback.
