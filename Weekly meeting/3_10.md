# MSc Project Meeting Notes  

## Meeting Details  
- **Date:** March 10, 2025  
- **Time:** 16:00 - 16:50  
- **Participants:** Duyu Yang (student), Haocheng Li (student), Dr. Darren White (supervisor), Dr. Kirsty Pringle (supervisor)  

## Agenda  
1. **Report Progress Presentation**  
2. **Supervisor's Feedback on the Report**  

## Discussion Summary  

### 1. Add More Images and Descriptions  
- The report currently includes only two figures; more visualizations should be added to better highlight the work completed.  
- The **London animation (Figure 2)** is not clearly describedâ€”it should be explicitly stated as an **animation**, not an interactive visualization.  
- Providing an **external link** for readers to view the animation directly would be beneficial.  

### 2. Explain Visualization Methods  
- The report should explain **why specific visualization techniques were chosen** and what information they aim to convey.  
- For example, the **Air Quality Stripe** is designed to show **trends** rather than specific numerical comparisons.  

### 3. Balance Between Animations and Dashboard  
- Explore different animation techniques or **combine animations with a dashboard** to ensure sufficient project workload.  
- Clearly distinguish **animations and the dashboard** in the report and specify their respective target audiences.  

### 4. Consider Different User Groups  
- **Animations are aimed at the general public** to raise awareness about air quality.  
- **The dashboard is designed for professionals** who need in-depth data analysis.  
- The report should emphasize **the distinction between these two components** and clarify the **target audience** for each.  

### 5. Ensure a Complete Work Plan  
- The project phases, from preparation to final report submission, should be clearly outlined, including **specific timelines and milestones**.  

## Tasks for the Upcoming Week  
- Revise the report based on the feedback.
