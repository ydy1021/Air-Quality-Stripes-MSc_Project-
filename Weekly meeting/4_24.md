### Discussion Summary  

#### 1. **JSON Annotation System**  
- Converted the **CSV-based annotation system** to a **JSON-based structure**, with all JSON files organized by city.  
- Enhanced the tool to support:
  - **Displaying existing bubbles**
  - **Editing and deleting annotations**
  - **Automatic offset calculation**
- JSON files now contain both **PM2.5 data** and **annotation metadata**.

#### 2. **Offset Adjustment Discussion**  
- Discussed how offset recalculates when the annotation text is modified.
- Supervisor suggested allowing **manual override** of offsets to prevent unintended overwrites.
- Proposed adding an **offset editing feature** within the GUI tool for better control and usability.

### Next Steps  
- Implement offset editing in the tool to support **manual fine-tuning**.  
- Review and improve JSON structure for **easier data access** and **robust annotation handling**.

### Meeting Conclusion  
- Current system is working well; focus now shifts to improving **flexibility and user experience** in annotation editing.
