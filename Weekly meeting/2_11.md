### MSc Project Meeting Notes  

### Meeting Details  
- **Date:** February 11, 2025  
- **Time:** 16:00 AM - 17:00 PM  
- **Participants:** Duyu Yang (student), Haocheng Li (student), Dr. Darren White (supervisor), Dr. Kirsty Pringle (supervisor)  

### Agenda  
1. **Code Presentation**  
   - Demonstration of the slider-based visualization program for air quality trends over different years using Python.  
2. **Tasks for the Upcoming Week**  

### Discussion Summary  
1. **Slider-Based Visualization Presentation**  
   - We presented the interactive visualization developed over the past week and explained the implementation process.  
   - The supervisor provided feedback on improvements, particularly regarding color selection. Using a gradient from dark to light and then back to dark may not be the optimal choice. Instead, increasing concentrations should generally be represented from light to dark for better clarity.  
   - It was also suggested to add a "90+" category in the color scale to avoid misleading viewers into thinking that 90 is the maximum value.  

2. **City Data Extraction Methods**  
   - Discussed methods for extracting air quality data for specific cities.  
   - The supervisor introduced two approaches:  
     - **Nearest Neighbor Method**: Selecting the grid box closest to the city coordinates.  
     - **Interpolation Method**: Using surrounding grid boxes to calculate a weighted average for improved accuracy.  

3. **Tasks for the Upcoming Week**  
   - **Reimplement the slider-based visualization** to work with a larger dataset spanning from 1850 to 2022.  
   - **Extract air quality data for specific cities** and compare weighted and unweighted datasets.  
   - **Attempt to reproduce air quality stripes** as an alternative visualization method.
