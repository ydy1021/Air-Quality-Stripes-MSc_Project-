# PM2.5 Data Visualization and Viewer

This repository contains two Python scripts for processing and visualizing PM2.5 concentration data from NetCDF files. The first script (`generate_pm25_maps.py`) processes NetCDF files and generates annual PM2.5 concentration maps. The second script (`pm25_viewer.py`) provides an interactive Tkinter-based GUI to browse through the generated images.

## **1. PM2.5 Data Processing (`generate_pm25_maps.py`)**
This script reads NetCDF files containing PM2.5 concentration data, extracts the relevant information, and generates images for each available year. The generated images are saved in a specified output directory.

### **Features**
- Reads PM2.5 data from NetCDF files.
- Extracts relevant geospatial data (longitude, latitude).
- Uses a non-uniform colormap for better visualization.
- Saves output images as PNG files with appropriate labels.

### **Dependencies**
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the script:
```bash
pip install xarray matplotlib numpy
